Write a Java program that determines a studentâ€™s grade.

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		determineGrade();
	}

	private static void determineGrade() {
		int QuizScore = 0, MidTermScore = 0, FinalScore = 0, Average = 0;
		
		System.out.println("Please enter your Quiz Score: ");
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		QuizScore = sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println("Please enter your Mid Term Score: ");
		MidTermScore = sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println("Please enter your Final Score: ");
		FinalScore = sc.nextInt();
		Average = 	(QuizScore+MidTermScore+FinalScore)/3;
		
		if(Average>=90){
			System.out.println("The average score is: "+Average+" Your grade = A" );
		}
		else if(Average>70 && Average<90){
			System.out.println("The average score is: "+Average+" Your grade = B" );
		}
		else if(Average>=50 && Average<70){
			System.out.println("The average score is: "+Average+" Your grade = C" );
		}
		else
			System.out.println("The average score is: "+Average+" Your grade = F" );
		
	}
}
